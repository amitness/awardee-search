pip install virtualenv 
virtualenv venv
```
* Activate your virtual environment
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

```

* Fire up your local webserver:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
* In a web browser, go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/), and you should see the development site! Please not that the terminal window you are running the development site in must stay open while you are using the site.
* When daily development is complete, terminate the local web server by typing ```CONTROL + C```. Also deactivate the virtual environment:
